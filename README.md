# Miatu
Miatu is a simple open-source image viewer for Windows and *NIX systems written in Lazarus. 
<br>
Miatu does not need to be installed. This program is distributed in a single executable file, but creates a configuration file.

#
### How can I build Miatu from source?
To build Miatu from source you need the [Lazarus development environment](https://lazarus-ide.org).<br>
To build Miatu for other systems and architectures you need Lazarus and [cross compilation](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Cross_compiling).
